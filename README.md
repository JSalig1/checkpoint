Checkpoint is an interactive goal setting app designed for fitness, Crossfit in
my case. The idea is that people should be able to set goals, break them down
into smaller goal steps or "checkpoints" and check them off as each
goal/checkpoint is reached.

If you have a coaching relationship with another user, your goals have added
functionality where you can send a review request to your coach and they can see
and edit your checkpoints associated with that goal or create new ones.

For demo purposes I have an account set up u: athlete@athlete.com p: athlete

Please feel free to try it out or create accounts of your own. I intend to
continue development on this app after I have acquired added expeience and
skills in javascript frameworks. Right now I'm simply using *.js.erb files for
DOM manipulation.
